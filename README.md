## Getting Started

##### If you don't have node run:

`./setup_node.sh`

Which will install nvm and node and run npm install

##### If you do have node:

The usual `npm install`
(You can install grunt globally and replace all local paths to grunt-cli with just `grunt`)
#### For developement locally:

`node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt dev`

This will concat the js and start an express server on `localhost:3333` with / pointing to the root folder, along with a watcher.

There's a sample page available at `localhost:3333/app/sample/index.html`

#### For creating a distributable (unminifined):
